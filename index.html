# generateWord at random and store it in a variable

#CHOOSE RANDOM WORD
# The chosen word only includes letters (no numbers, symbols, or whitespace).
# The chosen word should be randomly selected from a word bank.

#GUESS LETTER OR WORD
# When a player enters a single character, it guesses a letter.
# When a player enters more than a single character, it guesses the word.

#CHECK GUESSED LETTERS
# If the guessed letter is within the word, those letters are unveiled.
# Display the number of times the letter is found when it is present.
# If the guessed letter is not within the word, subtract one from the chances remaining.
# The user is alerted if the guess is not found.
# If the guessed letter was already submitted, do not decrement the chances remaining.
# Display an error message if the letter was already guessed.

#CHECK GUESSED WORD
# If the guessed word matches the hidden word, the player wins the game.
# Output a congratulatory message if the guess was correct.
# If the guessed word does not match the hidden word, the player loses the game.
# Output an apologetic message if the guess was incorrect.

#GAME OVER WHEN NO MORE CHANCES
# The game ends when the number of chances remaining reaches zero.
# The user is alerted that they have run out of guesses
